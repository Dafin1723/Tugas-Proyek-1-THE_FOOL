# 🃏 THE FOOL

## About Us

**THE FOOL** is a small team consisting of three members:
- **Dafin**
- **Fikri**
- **Amru**

This team was formed to work on an **internship project from Gamelab**.  
More than just completing tasks, this repository represents our learning journey, collaboration, and growth as a team.

---

## 📖 Training Background

Before starting the main internship project, we completed **3 weeks of intensive training**, covering essential fundamentals:

- **Python Basics**
- **Git & Git Collaboration**

This training helped us build a strong foundation in programming logic, version control, and teamwork.  
It also trained us to work with structured workflows and proper collaboration practices.

---

## 🃏 The Meaning Behind “THE FOOL”

The name **THE FOOL** is inspired by the donghua **Lord of the Mysteries (LOTM)**.

In LOTM, *The Fool* does not symbolize stupidity.  
It represents **the beginning of a journey** — a figure who starts with limited knowledge but unlimited potential.

For us, **THE FOOL** stands for:
- Starting from zero without pretending to know everything  
- Having the courage to learn, explore, and make mistakes  
- Staying humble while continuously improving  

As interns, we accept that we are still learners.  
This name reminds us to stay curious, grounded, and consistent throughout our internship journey.

---

## 🎯 Team Goals

Our main objectives during this internship are:
- Strengthening programming skills, especially in Python  
- Practicing real-world collaboration using Git  
- Applying training knowledge into real projects  
- Building discipline, responsibility, and teamwork  

---

## 🛠 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A collaboration space for team development  
- A collection of training exercises and internship projects  
- Documentation of our progress during the Gamelab internship  

Every contribution is made with the goal of learning together and improving as a team.

---

## 🚀 Closing Note

Every expert was once a beginner.  
**THE FOOL** reminds us that true growth begins when we are willing to learn.
